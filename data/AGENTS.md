## Product Info

`product-info.ndjson` is where info about products is stored to facilitate efficient product entries into the inventory.

- It should contain only one example entry in the project repo, but will be filled with user info once deployed and in use.
- Additional entries made by the service should match the format of the peanut butter example.

## Inventory

`inventory.ndjson` is where the users inventory is stored.
